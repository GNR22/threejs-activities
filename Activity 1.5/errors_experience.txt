What went wrong:
1. Module System vs Script Tags
You had Node modules (three in package.json)

But you were trying to use <script src="three.min.js">

These are incompatible approaches

2. The Fix:
javascript
// OLD (didn't work with your setup):
// <script src="three.min.js"></script>
// const scene = new THREE.Scene()

// NEW (works with Vite + Node modules):
import * as THREE from 'three'
const scene = new THREE.Scene()
Why it works now:
npm run dev starts Vite development server

Vite handles the module imports and bundling

import * as THREE from 'three' properly loads the library from node_modules

The two approaches:
Simple HTML (instructions): Download three.min.js â†’ use script tags
Modern Development (your setup): npm install three â†’ use import statements
You were trying approach #1 with approach #2's file structure! Now you're using the proper module system that matches your Vite setup. ðŸŽ¯
